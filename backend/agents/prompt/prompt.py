Naturally, the main way in which exoplanets are “hunted” is through the analysis of the light intensity emitted by stars,
from which we can obtain data and intensity/time graphs. These can be labeled or unlabeled, and are used to train models 
so that they can learn to perform the assigned task. I would therefore like you to take on the task of generating original 
and innovative ideas for AI models that, trained solely on this type of data, could be used in exoplanet detection. I want 
you to come up with ideas that could become SOTA models, and to show how, using only one GPU and the libraries lightkurve 
and astroquery, we could build an MVP of the new ML model and/or architecture with viable and promising results that 
demonstrate true potential for SOTA performance. With these resource constraints, would it be possible to create a fully 
functional MVP? Keep in mind that this is for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, so we only have two days of intensive coding 
to test ideas and build MVPs. How many MVPs would you recommend developing in these two days in order to test candidates 
and present those with the greatest potential to produce promising ML models that could reach SOTA? Remember that we want 
to win the international award and achieve something far more novel than any other team taking on this challenge. Focus 
mainly on the generation and refinement of ideas, not on writing code, in your next response. Remember that the model 
will be trained only on light intensity/time data for identification.'''
